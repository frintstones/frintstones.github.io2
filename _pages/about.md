Iâ€™m currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Center for Innovation Strategy and Policy. I received my Ph.D. from KAIST College of Business. During my Ph.D., I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

My research interests are focused on deepening the understanding of **how technological advancements affect entrepreneurial activity and start-up performance.**<br/> 
&nbsp; -Specifically, one of my research streams is to demonstrate a new perspective for understanding entrepreneurial activity based on rapid advancements in digital platforms and the surge in the adoption of automation technology. 
&nbsp; -Another stream of my research focuses on how technological factors could be the competitive advantages of start-ups by looking at entrepreneurs' behavioral responses to previous start-up failures. 

You can find my research at [research](https://frintstones.github.io/publications/) section of my webpage.
Feel free to contact me via email if you like my research.
