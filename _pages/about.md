RESEARCH INTERESTS
======

My research interests are focused on deepening the understanding of how technological advancements affect entrepreneurial activity and start-up performance. Specifically, one of my research streams is to demonstrate a new perspective for understanding entrepreneurial activity based on rapid advancements in digital platforms and the surge in the adoption of automation technology. Another stream of my research focuses on how technological factors could be the competitive advantages of start-ups by looking at entrepreneurs' behavioral responses to previous start-up failures. Overall, my research suggests that new technological development, such as digital platforms and automation technology, and strategic decisions after prior start-up failure could be critical deterministic factors to explain entrepreneurial activities in society.
